<span class="s0">Made by Emily Moran and Marilyn Pamias</span>

<span class="s0">Overview</span><span class="s1">:</span>

    <span class="s2">This projects goal is to create a virtual environment that allows for the</span>
    <span class="s2">analysis and graphing of a sound that is input into the program. The</span>
    <span class="s2">program should be user friendly meaing that with the use of a GUI there</span>
    <span class="s2">will be a load input button for the sound file. After the input is aquired</span>
    <span class="s2">the program will display a total of 6 graphs that show the waveform, low</span>
    <span class="s2">frequency, high frequency, middle frequency, a combined graph and a</span>
    <span class="s2">spectograph.</span>

<span class="s0">Purpose</span><span class="s1">:</span>

    <span class="s2">The project allows us to utilize GUI to read file inputs and display graphs.</span>
    <span class="s2">It also was an opportunity to understand how collaborations in the programming</span>
    <span class="s2">industry can be and look like.</span>

 <span class="s0">Usage Instructions</span><span class="s1">:</span>

    <span class="s2">Run the program from the Run_Program_Here.py</span>
    <span class="s2">USe the audio file from the folder or any </span>
    <span class="s2">.wav, .mp4, or .acc</span>
